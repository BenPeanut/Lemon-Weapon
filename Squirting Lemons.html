  <p style="font-size: 20px;">One of the most common ways to use lemons is for squeezing onto food or making lemonade.
    That is only one of the many helpful ways to use lemons. The first way to use a lemon
    to protect yourself/attack someone is the squeeze the juice into their eye. This will give you time to do
